# Introduction
Research in social science the things about networks start from graphy theory.
They use Freedom Summer as an example, which shows people are likely to parcipate in activities when their friends already joined in. 

## Lattice network or spatial/geographic network 

### dimension
(1) one dimension: one line  

(2) two dimensions: a grid 

(3) three dimensions: it seems this one is not usual
### tips

When we focus on one dimensional lattice network, we might be interested in situation: adjacent and next two nodes connection

When we focus on two dimensional lattice network, we might be interested in Moore Neighborhood: up, down, left, right and four corners


## Random Network or Erdos-Renyi Random Graph
### component and threshold 

(1) A component refers to a set of nodes that are all connected.

(2) As you connect the nodes, you see a sharp threshold. 

As the number of edges you created passes this threshold, the graph is nearly guaranteed to suddenly become one single giant connected component.
The threshold exists in this value P and its equal to log (N) divided by N. 
So when P is equal to a log (N) divided by N, your network is almost guaranteed mathematically to be one giant connected component. 

(3) In a large graph, if two distant nodes have connection, the spread will be much faster. It indicates the large random network will have low average path length. 


## Lattice vs. random
Lattice: 1) friends know each other; 2) high clustering coefficient; 3) this is simpler than complex world
Randow: 1) do not know each other; 2) low clustering coefficient; 3) more like the real world
