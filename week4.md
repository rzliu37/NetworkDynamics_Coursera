# Introduction

Unpopular norms: naked emperors (result from central anthority?), luxury fever.

Description: People accepted the unpopular norms and continued to enforce others to accept it. 

Why: central anthority? or other drivers? It is hard to research in real world, since people would hide their real thoughts.



# Components of a norm:
When everybody complies and enforces, nobody wants todeviate.

Once the norm is in place, it is rational that for the norm to stay in place, it is a stable equilibrium. 

But how to reach the equilibrium? 

## (1) Compliance

## (2) Enforcement 


# Modeling compliance and enforcement

## (1) True believer: 
a person honestly believes in their behavior
 
## (2) False believer:
a person honestly does not believe in their behavior

## (3) True enforcer: 
also in a true believer

## (4) False enforcer:
also in a false believer

## Cluster
If there is more clusters, false enforcer will finally cover the most of the population. 

## Embeddedness
### Q
In video 4.4, why is it harder to for agents to become false enforcers when the embeddedness is turned off? 
Wouldn't it be easier for it to spread since they are exposed to more true believers?

### A
"The EMBEDDEDNESS toggle determines whether agents react only to the behavior of their immediate neighbors (when EMBEDDEDNESS is set to TRUE) ,
or whether they react to the behavior of the entire population (when EMBEDDEDNESS is set to FALSE)."

Accordingly, if the agent observes the entire population do not (globally) adopt the new norm, they will not adopt it either. 

Embeddedness means when individual made a decision, he/she would depend on others behavior, especially who is close to them. 



# Falsification and sufficiency in the emperor's dilemma

## Sufficient conditions
Minimum required conditions that spread a norm across a population

## Falsify a claim
Demonstrating minimal sufficient conditions that do not require assumptions that were previusly held.

## Emperor's Dilemma

### Previous assumption
Norms could only spread if beneficial

### Emperor's Dilemma model
Norms can spread even if nobody wants them

## Tips
Assuming that there was a global information, when everyone could see everyone else in the population
The norm never got started, because there was enough information abou thte fact

But if there was a local informatin, the rogues could put sufficient social pressure on their neighbors within a small neighborhood to convince them that this was something they had to do

# SUMMARY
这章节主要用皇帝的新衣这个故事，来展现出以下几点：

（1）如果是集权或者上下阶级的制度，容易产生强迫他人接受他们并不认同的观点

（2）人们接受自己并不认同的观点可能是为了隐藏自己真实的观点

（3）人们的真实观点与实际行动可能是不同的

（4）即便是缺乏权力的压迫，观点也可以传播。

（5）广泛传播的不一定是好的

（6）蜜糖 vs 砒霜，要考虑个人以及context。
